**So What did I do during Community Bonding!!!**

hmmm, Let me see. Well It was not a busy one on outreachy activities as I still had school to finish however we had calls once every week with my mentor Ali Maredia.

**Major High Lights**

**Community Introduction**

I was introduced to the Ceph community. I got to know the different people I can contact in case i got stack with anything on the project. It was a warm welcome.

**Ceph Overflow**

I had learn more about [ceph](https://github.com/ceph/ceph) during the application period as continued doing so.

**Connecting to RGW instead of Amazon.com**

I had much confusion on especially the RGW s3 interface. I knew that I was supposed to write tests that test the RGW s3 interface. However I kept wondering how will I point to RGW instead of Amazon.com. And I did not know that actually i needed to just change the endpoint and some small hacking to be good. You must be laughing at me right :) I am also laughing at my self after getting to know.

Being a total newbie it has been interesting. If I said I have been so fast at getting these concepts , I would be a lier as the whole connection concept got clearer in my first week of summer.

Today,which is beginning of week 2 at the start of summer, Iam now hacking the connection.

**Capacity Building**

The project is to be implemented in three languages Go, Java and C++. Of the three languages , I was farmiliar with Java and Go however did not know alot of C++. So my first priority was building capacity on C++ so that by summer I was confortable using it. 

This went as planned. I learned alot of C++, and was helped by my mentor on cmake. Last weekend I wrote a cmakelists.txt file that I am proud of. Now am kinda guru!!! 

I also read up on the AWS SDks for all the languages I will be using on the project. I appreciate the documentation out there because it has been resourceful.

**Way forward**

I am now ready for the coding Period.
