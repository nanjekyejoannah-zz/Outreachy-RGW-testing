**Tests Up and running**

This week I worked on ensuring that the tests execute.

**Achievements**

+ I have written up to 30 working tests.
+ I Also got feedback for them which included:

	+ Ensuring that my codefiles end with newline.
	+ Ensuring that my config is consumable by tethology.
	+ Ensuring that the instructions for running the tests actually work.

+ I wrote two blogs; one on what I did for my week 1 and 2. The other on my open source journey. 

**Blockers**

+ Still to find out with details from mentor why the tests are not executing in his environment.

**Tasks for the Next Week**

+ Implement majority of the tests this week. Ensure I am 60% in coverage of the tests in the python suite now that I have running tests.
+ Ensure Mentor is able to run tests.
+ Discuss an [issue](https://github.com/nanjekyejoannah/go_s3tests/issues/1) opened on the project 
+ Get feedback for the tests I worked on.
+ Chat with mentor later this week on teuthology Integration.
